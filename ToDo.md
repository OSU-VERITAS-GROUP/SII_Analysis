# To-Do

As with any project there are a number of improvements to still be made. Let's keep track of some of them. 

1. The first big to do is the transtions of MultiThread to correlating all 6 pairs of telscopes at once. This key change will *drastically* simlify the complex directory structure currently needed for each run/pair. However, subsequent analysis steps will also need to be changed in turn. 
2. Add U/V to Calculate Delays 
3. Streamline matching up Off-Data (*Likely Very difficult*)
